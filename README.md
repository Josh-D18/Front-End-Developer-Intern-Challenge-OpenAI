# Front-End-Developer-Intern-Challenge-OpenAI

Built out this project using React, TypeScript and Tailwind Css

## The Challenge

You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

We'd like your app to have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
* A form for entering text prompts
* Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
* Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. 
* Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.

### Technical requirements

* Results should come from OpenAI’s completions API, for which you’ll need a free API key (no credit card required). Detailed signup instructions are included below.
* We’ve provided screenshots below of demo apps we built using the OpenAI API. 
* We recommend using the “text-curie-001” AI engine which is a good balance between speed, cost, and accuracy (example code below)
* You are free to use any front end framework/component library you like (or none at all!)
* Each result should include at least the original prompt you entered and the response from the API.
* Responses should be stored in order of newest to oldest.
* The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference)
